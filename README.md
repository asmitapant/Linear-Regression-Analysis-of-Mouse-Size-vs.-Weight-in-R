This R script demonstrates a simple linear regression model using a custom dataset of mouse weights and sizes. The model evaluates the relationship between weight (predictor variable) and size (response variable), and visualizes the trend with a scatterplot and regression line.
What happens in the Code, let's discuss in brief

Firstly, A small dataset mouse.data is created with weights and corresponding sizes of three mice.

Secondly, model Building: lm(size~weight) fits a linear regression line to predict size from weight.

Than, summary Output: summary() shows regression coefficients, residuals, RÂ² value, and significance.

Lastly, visualization: plot() creates a scatterplot of the data.

abline() draws the regression line over the plot in red, illustrating the trend.
